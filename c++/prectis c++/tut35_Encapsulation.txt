Hiding “sensitive” data from the user. Encapsulation is achieved in C++ using
Classes.

Classes have two main components:
1. Data Members
2. Member Function

Access Modifiers:

Access modifiers are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the
accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. Access modifiers are used
to facilitate the encapsulation of components.


There are 3 types of Access Modifiers:

1. Public : Class objects can access the data members and function outside the
class.

2. Private : Objects cannot access the data members and function outside the
class. These members can only be accessed inside the class.

3. Protected : Objects cannot access the data members and function outside
the class. These members can be accessed inside the class and inherited
class.

Advantages of Encapsulation:
- Good coding practice, useful in interviews
- Increased security of data
